Design how the DND name generator will work

++++++++++++++++Design++++++++++++++++++++++


Open NameKeeper
"Hello! welcome to the inn. If you're looking for the name of a someone, you can try asking me."

Give me a male dwarf name

"Alexa. Ask NameKeeper for a {male} {human} name."

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


[] open the app and randomly generate a male dwarf name every time
[x] accept a user utterance with two input parameters, gender and race
	[x] make those input parameters enums
	[] handle an exception if the user input doesnt fit known values for the enum
	[] allow the user to omit values
	









====Future features=======
"What races are supported?"
"Give me a random name"

"Give me a random character"


"Give me a random foe"

"Give me a random Inn name"
